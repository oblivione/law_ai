# GitHub Pages Setup Guide

## ðŸš¨ GitHub Pages Not Enabled - Manual Setup Required

The deployment is failing because GitHub Pages is not enabled for this repository. Here are the steps to enable it:

## Option 1: Enable GitHub Pages (Recommended)

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings
1. Go to repository: https://github.com/oblivione/law_ai
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Re-run the Workflow
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on the failed workflow
3. Click **Re-run all jobs**

## Option 2: Alternative Deployment Workflows

I've created two deployment workflows:

### Workflow 1: `pages.yml` (Official GitHub Pages)
- Uses official GitHub Pages API
- Requires Pages to be enabled first
- More robust and recommended

### Workflow 2: `deploy-simple.yml` (Fallback)
- Uses peaceiris/actions-gh-pages
- Automatically creates gh-pages branch
- Works without pre-enabling Pages

## Option 3: Manual Branch Deployment

If workflows fail, you can manually deploy:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/oblivione/law_ai.git
cd law_ai

# Build the React app
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build

# Deploy to gh-pages branch
npx gh-pages -d build
```

## Expected Results

Once GitHub Pages is enabled, the React app will be available at:
**https://oblivione.github.io/law_ai**

## Troubleshooting

### If Pages settings are not visible:
1. Repository must be public
2. Repository owner must have appropriate permissions
3. GitHub Pages may be disabled for the organization

### If deployment still fails:
1. Try the simple deployment workflow
2. Check repository permissions
3. Verify the gh-pages branch is created
4. Check Actions permissions in repository settings

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
2. âœ… Re-run the failed workflow
3. âœ… Access the deployed app at the GitHub Pages URL
4. âœ… Verify all features work correctly

**Note**: The repository and code are ready - only GitHub Pages activation is needed!
# Repository is now public - GitHub Pages should be available!

## ðŸ”§ Permission Issues Fixed

The previous deployment failed due to GitHub Actions permission issues. Fixed by:

1. **Added proper permissions** to workflows:
   ```yaml
   permissions:
     contents: read
     pages: write
     id-token: write
   ```

2. **Created new static.yml workflow** using official GitHub Pages deployment
3. **Disabled problematic workflows** that used gh-pages branch approach
4. **Simplified to single-job deployment** to avoid token issues

The new workflow should deploy successfully without permission errors.
